## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. **Professional Summary Missing in PDF** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Professional Summary section was not appearing in generated PDF resumes.

**Root Cause:** The code only checked for `getEnhancedProfessionalSummary()` and ignored the regular `getProfessionalSummary()` field.

**Solution:**
```java
// Now uses fallback logic - prefers enhanced version, shows original if enhanced is null
String profSummary = resume.getEnhancedProfessionalSummary() != null && !resume.getEnhancedProfessionalSummary().isEmpty()
    ? resume.getEnhancedProfessionalSummary()
    : resume.getProfessionalSummary();
```

**Impact:** Both Career Objective and Professional Summary now display correctly with enhanced versions taking priority.

### 2. **Classic Template Not Professional Enough** ✅ IMPROVED

**Changes Made:**
- **Font:** Changed from Georgia/Times New Roman to Calibri/Arial (more modern, ATS-friendly)
- **Color Scheme:** Updated from #0066cc (bright blue) to #1a5490 (professional navy blue)
- **Typography:**
  - Header: 28pt (reduced from 32px for better proportion)
  - Section headers: 14pt with proper spacing
  - Body text: 11pt with 1.6 line-height
- **Layout:**
  - Added `@page` margins for print optimization
  - Better spacing between sections
  - Improved skill badges with subtle borders
  - Professional contact info formatting
- **ATS Optimization:**
  - Clean, parseable structure
  - Standard section headings
  - Proper semantic HTML
  - Print-friendly styling

**Before vs After:**
```
Before: Georgia serif font, bright #0066cc blue, 32px headers
After:  Calibri sans-serif, professional #1a5490 navy, 28pt headers
```
